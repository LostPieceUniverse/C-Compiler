# My C Compiler
## Disclaimer

This project is a work in progress and should not be taken seriously. As a novice in the realm of compiler development, 
I am exploring various concepts and experimenting with implementation details. Expect frequent changes and inconsistencies as 
I continue to learn and refine my approach.

## Project Overview

This C compiler is a personal endeavor, developed sporadically in my free time. At its current stage, 
the primary goal is to implement basic functionality such as printing strings and evaluating integer expressions. 
Features like compiler optimization and syntax checking are not yet addressed and may be ignored for the time being.

## Current Limitations

- Strings are currently handled as simple `"strings"`. Complex string manipulation and handling of arrays are not implemented.
- Control flow constructs like if-else statements or functions are not supported.
- The focus is on arithmetic expressions and basic output functionalities for now.

## Future Directions

In future iterations, I plan to expand the capabilities of the compiler to include more advanced features, such as:

- Implementing control flow statements for branching and looping.
- Enhancing string handling and array operations.
- Incorporating compiler optimizations for improved performance.
- Strengthening syntax checking and error handling mechanisms.(maybe)

## Documentation

For detailed planning, thoughts, notes and project management, please refer to the `doc.md` file. 
This document serves as a personal repository of ideas, plans, and reflections on the development journey of this compiler. 
It outlines the current progress, future milestones, and any additional notes pertinent to the project's evolution.

## Note of Caution

Please approach this project with skepticism. While I am enthusiastic about its potential, it is still in its infancy, and significant changes are expected. 
Any feedback or suggestions are welcome as I continue to develop and refine this compiler.
